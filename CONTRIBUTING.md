## Contributing

#### Want to submit an issue/bug or an idea?
If you are having issues, ran into a bug or have an idea/request for a feature, please submit an Issue here on GitHub (using the Issues button in the menu above.) 

If you don't know how to use GitHub, you can also send an email to carmodym2+mankinence AT gmail DOT com.
I will try my best to help you solve the problem.


#### Want to contribute with code or documentation?
Pull requests are welcome! Though I recommend getting in touch with me before putting in too much work!
(A lot of the commit history was left behind in the transition and can be found in [the old repo](https://github.com/searene/Anki-Addons).)
