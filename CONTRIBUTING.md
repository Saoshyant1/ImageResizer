#### Common Issues

###### Blurry images
If you aren't satisfied with the quality of the image after its resized, try changing your Settings.
Make sure you have `use smooth transformation` set, this makes the paste slower but higher quality.
The [README](README.md) has specific instructions for accessing and changing settings.
This small change can make a big difference, here's an example:

<img src="images/fast_vs_smooth.png">

If you pasted a small image that was made bigger and became blurry even with `use smooth transformation` set,
you may just need to use the original image size for small images.
See the next Common Issue below.

###### Small images are being made bigger
If you don't want small images to be made bigger, check the `Disable upscaling` box in the Settings menu.
See the [README](README.md) for how to access and change settings.
